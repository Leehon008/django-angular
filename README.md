# Integrating Django and Angular Trivia Game
- we built the backend API for a Progressive Web Application that will serve data to our project’s frontend interface. We used Django models to create and populate our database and the Django Rest Framework to create an API endpoint for our application’s UI to consume. With this in place, we also built the frontend of our trivia game PWA and create the user interface code with Angular.

## Requirements installed
 > $ pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers requests
